# TwitchPlaysHangman
A Hangman clone controlled via IRC.

Designed for use with Twitch chat.

Includes:
 - Player database system
 - Leaderboard (in chat and on screen)
 - Commands for guessing, as well as betting points on letters + some other stuff
 - Statistics (%localappdata%)

Network credentials are constants (macros in Studio), so you need to change them first in order to make it work.

------

Created using GameMaker: Studio mostly in 2015.

Word lists compiled/taken from http://www.manythings.org/ and http://www.ashley-bovan.co.uk/.
