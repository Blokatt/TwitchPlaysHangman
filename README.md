# TwitchPlaysHangman
A Hangman clone controlled via IRC.

Designed for use with Twitch chat.

Includes:
 - User database system
 - Leaderboard (in chat and on screen)
 - Commands for guessing, as well as betting points on letters + some other stuff
 - Statistics (%localappdata%)

Network credentials are macros, so you need to change them first in order to make it work.
